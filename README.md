# SimpleQEMUx86
A simple QEMU-x86_64 CLI script that allows anyone to take advantage of the high performance of QEMU+KVM without the burden of VMM or other software.

The software is in its early stages, so please do not try to poke holes in it or mess it up. Thank you. The HDD size is in gigabytes and the RAM size is in megabytes. Please only type numbers. The number of CPUs maxes out at 255. When loading a CDROM/iso/img, please input the whole path from the / directory OR if the file is in the directory of the script, you can input a relative directory.

**INSTALLATION:**
1. Place the .sh file into a directory of your choice. We recommend you create a new folder somewhere in your system, but you don't have to. Then, open the script. That's all. No installation, no binaries, none of that. To run: navigate to the directory of the script and then type ./(the name of the script, vm.sh by default) You may have to go into the directory and type sudo chmod +rwx (the name of the script) to run it.

Enjoy!
